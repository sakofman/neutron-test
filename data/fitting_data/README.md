isotopes_to_fit.txt contains the names of the isotopes to be fitted.
(future) when this is a program, the user selects which isotopes to fit and the selected isotopes will be saved via this text file so they can be stored/loaded when the program is restarted. 

isotopes_data.txt contains all available isotope data -- basic properties (stored locally in the same file) and cross-section data (stored locally in data/cross_section_data/isotope_name.txt)

constants.txt contains equation constants (proton_pulse_gap, flight_path, trigger_delay, time_bin, min_E, max_E, crs_skip_pts)
